# Fake-News-Detection-System
A fake news detection system using ML and DL

This includes various data cleaning techniques like lemmatization, stopword removal, punctuation, handling missing and duplicated data. It also involves data visualisation (including word clouds), label encoding and training various models: 

ML: 
  1. Naive Bayes
  2. Logistic Regression
  3. Decision Tree
  4. Random Forest
  5. SVM
DL:
  1. CNN
  2. LSTM
     
The models have been evaluated on different metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score and classification matrix has also been made.
